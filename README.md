# Tattoo scheduling project

Early stage project to create a platform to allow tattoo artists to easily book
their flash designs.

Built in TypeScript on Deno with Oak and Fresh. Currently using MongoDB for the
DB to simplify development of the MVP, which will only cater to a single artist
(myself).
